Changes in 0.06:
 - Support flag (REQ_MULT_CONC_SYNTAX) requiring use of the multiple
   conclusions syntax.

Changes in 0.05:
 - The previous version would die with an assertion failure for some cases
   in which a later interface file introduced a statement with the same name
   as one introduced in an earlier interface file, rather than produce a
   helpful diagnostic. Fix that.
 - The previous version could halt with an assertion failure in some cases
   where a variable was introduced with the same name as an existing statement.
 - Rename 'mandatory variables' as 'wild variables' for better agreement
   with metamath usage and upcoming Ghilbert specification.
 - Correct some error messages and normal output to be more accurate and
   useful.


Changes in 0.04:
 - Add the ability to pretty-print expressions (SHUL_VERB_PRETTY_PRINT
   verbose flag) and to print detailed results produced during proofs
   (SHUL_VERB_PROOF, SHUL_VERB_PRFMAND verbose flags).
 - Output def's as terms in isave.
 - Fix a debug message regarding hypothesis ID reuse.

Changes in 0.03:
 - Add isave command to allow saving history as a .ghi file.
 - Fix a problem with 0-conclusion proofs introduced in 0.02.
